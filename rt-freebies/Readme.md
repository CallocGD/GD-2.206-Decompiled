# Robtop Freebies

Robtop Freebies are Code snippets that have already been shown or made public this here is a compilation of all of those 
that I was able to gather up. 

The reason for copying all of these onto a peice of paper or file is primarly to use as helpful references if something doesn't
seem right or when we don't know what any of these objects do. 

I primarly am using them as extra help to my cause however please be mindful if you try to go about using any of this 
knowelege as it might hold bugs or other sneakies that I may not be aware of. Also be mindful that this was in 
mid-development of 2.2.
