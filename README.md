# GD-Decompiled
 An attempt to get the source code for Geometry Dash through reverse engineering and decompiling the game.  


## Tools Used
See this [repo](https://github.com/CallocGD/Geometry-Dash-Miscellaneous-Decomp-Tools) I try to post new scripts regularly for ghidra and more in here.


# FYI
- If we end up decompiling this game 100% know that I will not be sharing assests to the game to prevent piracy.


## NOTES
I will be first attempting to write a program in python to track our progress using libclang to parse through the C++ functions. This will be tricky but should give everyone enough time to start making me the broma files and hooks we all desperately need.
