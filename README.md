# GD-Decompiled
 An attempt to get the source code for Geometry Dash through reverse engineering and decompiling the game.  


## Tools Used
See this [repo](https://github.com/CallocGD/Geometry-Dash-Miscellaneous-Decomp-Tools) I try to post new scripts regularly for ghidra and more in here.


# FYI
- If we end up decompiling this game 100% know that I will not be sharing assests to the game to prevent piracy.
