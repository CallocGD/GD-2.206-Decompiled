# GD-Decompiled
 An attempt to get the source code for Geometry Dash through reverse engineering and decompiling the game.  


## On Strike Currently
There was some nasty things said behind my back so I have currently not been doing anything. All the deocmp of GameObject is being paused for that reason.
It was meant as a gift for the community but as I had seen people be very quick to coming to conclusions before seeing the bigger picture hence why I am going 
on strike. If the geode community wants to be mean then you will recieve no help until you apoligize to me.


## Tools Used
See this [repo](https://github.com/CallocGD/Geometry-Dash-Miscellaneous-Decomp-Tools) I try to post new scripts regularly for ghidra and more in here.
- [GD-Decomp-Deploy](https://github.com/CallocGD/GD-Decomp-Deploy) Built me this repository and all the currently found signatures since the repo's creation date.
- Ghidra

# FYI
- If we end up decompiling this game 100% know that I will not be sharing assests to the game to prevent piracy.

- If you make a discovery and post it the gd programming server or somewhere else __please give credit where due__ if this decomp is attached to it. __I'm tired of skids saying they found important shit when something has already been known about or discovered months or even years before by someone else.__


## NOTES
I will be first attempting to write a program in python to track our progress using libclang to parse through the C++ functions. This will be tricky but should give everyone enough time to start making me the broma files and hooks we all desperately need.


# Current TODOS
- Making All Http/s Requests in the Game's Code Open source for programmers to easily see & replicate (Because GDDocs sometimes gets it wrong)
- Decompiling GameObject 100% Where all of it's class members have been given accurate names
- Not Currently in the Mood to move Previous code I've done excluding GameLevelManager however feel free to fork and make pull requests if you need those ones.
